Hello world!

This is the start of the Decentralized Data Compliance Working Group.

It is starting from within the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystem, but participants from any and all projects and protocols are welcome to join and participate. If you are involved with decentralized and p2p data and how that meets regulatory and compliance rules as users, service providers, and other participants, this is the place for you! 
 
* Introduce yourself in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/DDC-WG/discussions)
* Join the Slack channel in the public [Filecoin Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack) which is [#decent-data-compliance-wg](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C04ND9YSQCS)
* Check the calendar to join upcoming working group meetings https://lu.ma/ddc-wg
